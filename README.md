# MovieAnalysis
Capstone 2 python code for Springboard.

This code uses movie data originally obtained fro Kaggle to objectively identify the best movies and best actors since the industry was created in 1939.
I use three different criteria to rank the movies and actors:
  1) The gross profit for the movie.
  2) The popularity of the movie
  3) The number of "important" awards won by each movie. This data is derived from other databases I created.

The numbers from each criteria were then normalized and averaged, giving a "final score"
